# AirQualityMonitor
Small air quality monitoring script.

Uses a BME680 sensor to detect temperature, humidity, pressure, CO2 levels, VOC (volitile organic compound) levels, 
to calculate an indoor air quality. Stores all data in an InfluxDB time series database and displays it on a Grafana dashboard.
